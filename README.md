# UK Business Demographics: Applied Data Analytics Workflow

## Project Overview

This repository contains my coursework submission for the **DAT5501 – Applied Data Analytics Workflow** module at **Queen Mary University of London**.

The project analyses patterns in **UK business births, business deaths, and survival rates** using official regional datasets. The aim is to explore short- and long-term business resilience, with particular attention to structural changes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
## Repository Contents

### Data
- **Raw data** sourced from official UK business statistics
- **Processed datasets** cleaned and standardised for analysis

### Data Cleaning & Processing
- Python scripts for cleaning and transforming raw datasets
- Consistent naming conventions and numeric formatting
- Unit tests to verify cleaning logic

### Analysis & Visualisations
- Regional comparisons of business births and deaths (2019 vs 2024)
- Business survival analysis (1-year vs 5-year survival rates)
- Line charts, bar charts, and comparative visualisations created using Matplotlib

### Testing & Automation
- Pytest unit tests for data cleaning pipelines
- Continuous Integration using CircleCI
## Tools & Skills

- Python
- pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Unit testing with pytest
- Continuous Integration (CircleCI)
- Git & GitHub

## Purpose of the Project

This project was developed to demonstrate a complete data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to cleaned datasets, tested code, visual analysis, and written interpretation.

As I am still early in my data analytics journey, this repository also serves as a record of my technical development, problem-solving process, and increasing confidence working with real-world datasets.

## Future Improvements

- Extending survival analysis to additional cohorts
- Incorporating sector-level breakdowns where available
- Enhancing visualisations with interactive libraries
- Further expanding automated testing coverage
